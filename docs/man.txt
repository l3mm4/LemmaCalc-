LEMMA CALCULATOR(1)                         User Commands                         LEMMA CALCULATOR(1)

NAME
    LemmaCalc — a user-friendly command-line calculator with expression history, tab-completion,
    factorial support, assignment syntax, and built-in documentation.

SYNOPSIS
    python calc.py
    ./calc.py

DESCRIPTION
    LemmaCalc™ is a REPL-based command-line calculator with support for advanced math functions,
    variable assignments, and a helpful, discoverable interface. It evaluates Pythonic expressions
    safely and prints formatted results.

FEATURES
    • REPL input with expression parsing
    • Assignment support (e.g., x = 5, y = sqrt(x))
    • Tab-completion for functions like sin, sqrt, log, etc.
    • Multi-expression input via semicolon (e.g., a=5; b=6; a+b)
    • Expression history ('history')
    • Screen clearing ('clear')
    • Quit command ('q')
    • Built-in documentation ('man', 'tldr')

COMMANDS
    q           Quit the program.
    clear       Clear the screen and re-display instructions.
    history     Show all previous calculations in this session.
    man         Show this manual.
    tldr        Show a brief quick-reference guide.

SUPPORTED FUNCTIONS
    The following math functions are supported (via the math module):

        sqrt(x)         Square root of x
        log(x)          Natural logarithm (ln) of x
        log10(x)        Base-10 logarithm
        sin(x)          Sine of x (x in radians)
        cos(x)          Cosine of x (x in radians)
        tan(x)          Tangent of x (x in radians)
        factorial(x)    Factorial of x (x must be integer ≥ 0)
        abs(x)          Absolute value of x
        pow(x, y)       x raised to the power of y
        round(x, n)     Round x to n decimal places

EXAMPLES
    > 2 + 2
    Result: 4

    > a = 5
    a = 5

    > b = sqrt(a)
    b = 2.236...

    > a * b
    Result: 11.180...

    > history
    1: 2 + 2 = 4
    2: a = 5
    3: b = 2.23606797749979
    4: a * b = 11.180339887498949
